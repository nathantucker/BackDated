                    <p id="homesyn">BackDated is a fixture on Melbourne's outer eastern live music scene, cranking out its particular brand of classic rock at pubs, clubs, and private functions since 2007. Founding member Gordon Woodhams, the drummer of BackDated, is the common thread throughout the band's history - linking the starting line-up to its current classic incarnation. For many years a five-piece outfit, comprising of two guitars, bass, drums and male singer, BaackDated is now a six-piece, with the addition of a female singer. On this website you'll find the band's demo along with a brief look into the individual musicians part of BackDated.
